Copyleft:

GNU General Public License (GPL): The GPL is one of the most well-known copyleft licenses. 
It ensures that any modifications or derivative works of the software must also be released under the GPL,
preserving the openness and freedom of the software.

License Compatibility: The GPL is compatible with other GPL-licensed software,
allowing for easy integration and collaboration with other projects using the same license. 
This compatibility promotes the sharing and reuse of code within the GPL ecosystem.

Strong Copyleft: The GPL is a strong copyleft license, 
which means that it guarantees the continued openness and freedom of the software and any derivative works. 
By choosing the GPL, you ensure that modifications and enhancements made to your software must be released under the same license terms.
This helps prevent the software from being locked down or becoming proprietary.

Community Collaboration: The copyleft nature of the GPL encourages collaboration and sharing within the open source community. 
When others make improvements or modifications to GPL-licensed software, 
they are required to contribute those changes back to the community,
benefiting everyone involved. This fosters a culture of cooperation and collective development.

Protecting User Freedom: The GPL is designed to protect the freedoms of users.
It ensures that anyone who receives your software has the right to use, 
modify, and distribute it, including commercially.
